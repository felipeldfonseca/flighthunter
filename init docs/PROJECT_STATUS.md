# Project Status and Next Steps

## 1. Current Status

The project has undergone a significant architectural overhaul to prepare it for a production environment on Google Cloud Platform. The application is now stable, fully asynchronous, and connected to a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database.

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Database Migration:**
    *   The database has been successfully migrated from a local SQLite file to a managed **Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL** instance.
    *   A custom script (`convert_sqlite_to_postgres.py`) was developed to handle the data conversion between SQLite and PostgreSQL, ensuring a seamless transition.
    *   The **Cloud SQL Proxy** is now used to securely connect the local development environment to the Cloud SQL instance.

*   **Asynchronous Refactoring:**
    *   The entire FastAPI application has been refactored to be fully **asynchronous**.
    *   All database operations now use `async/await` with the `asyncpg` driver, and all services (`UserService`, `WatchlistService`, `StripeService`) and API endpoints have been updated accordingly.
    *   The application startup process has been corrected to eliminate the `ImportError` and `MissingGreenlet` errors that were previously blocking progress.

*   **Version Control:**
    *   The project is now under version control with **Git**.
    *   A remote repository has been set up on GitHub at [felipeldfonseca/flighthunter](https://github.com/felipeldfonseca/flighthunter), and all changes have been successfully pushed.
    *   A `.gitignore` file has been added to exclude unnecessary files and sensitive information from the repository.

## 2. Next Steps

With the core application now stable and robust, the next phase of the project involves deploying the application to a scalable, production-ready environment and setting up the necessary monitoring and alerting.

### Immediate Tasks:

*   **Containerization with Docker:**
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the FastAPI application. This will package the application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit for deployment.

*   **Deployment to Cloud Run:**
    *   Deploy the containerized application to **Google Cloud Run**, a fully managed serverless platform.
    *   Configure the Cloud Run service to securely connect to the Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Set up **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** to gain insights into the application's performance and to track any errors or issues.
    *   Configure budget alerts in Google Cloud to monitor and control costs associated with the deployed services.

These next steps will ensure that the "Flight Hunter" application is not only functional but also scalable, reliable, and easy to manage in a production environment.
